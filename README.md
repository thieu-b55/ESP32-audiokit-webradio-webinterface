copy the files in folder "SD card files" to a SD card FAT32 formatted and put it in the SD card holder of your board

read the readme file in this folder. The easiest way is to fill in the ssid and password before you start

Look in the folder "Pictures" at the picture switches and make sure you have the same configuration on your ESP32 audio kit board

Load the program esp32-A1S-web in your ESP32 audio kit.

After start-up go with a gsm that is connected to the same WI-FI station as the webradio and open webpage 192.168.1.177

That's all.


In case you didn't fill in the ssid or a password you don't have a webpage at 192.168.1.177

connect your GSM to the network >>  "ESP32webradio"   sometimes it takes a few moments before this shows up on your gsm

password >>  "ESP32pswd"

go to the webpage at 192.168.4.1

fill in ssid and password and push "bevestig"

Restart the webradio and you can enjoy life and good music
